## Research Task 7: Ethical Implications of Decision Making

This repository documents the transformation of an LLM-generated sports narrative (based on the "Coach Carter" scenario from Task 06) into a **stakeholder-facing decision report**. The process emphasizes **ethical analysis, reliability testing, and thorough documentation** to ensure the recommendations are accountable and auditable.

## 1. Process Documentation: Audit Log

### 1.1. Define Stakeholder & Decision Context

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stakeholders** | Syracuse University Athletic Director (AD) and Head Men's Basketball Coach. |
| **Decision Context** | Evaluating **resource allocation** (staff time, training focus) for the upcoming season to address statistical vulnerabilities. |
| **Risk Level** | **Medium.** Decisions impact team success, fan engagement, and player development, requiring careful ethical vetting before personnel changes. |

### 1.2. Data Provenance & Scope

* **Source:** **Synthetic statistical summary** created to simulate publicly available 2024-2025 SU Men's Basketball season data.
* **Privacy Concerns:** **Low.** Data is based on simulated aggregated, public statistics (e.g., shooting percentages, rebounding rates).
* **Limitation:** Data is synthetic and lacks crucial real-world context like opponent quality, injury status, or team chemistry.

### 1.3. Re-create / Validate Descriptive Results (Simulated)

The analysis centers on the high **Defensive Rebounding % (DRB%)** vulnerability and the **Malik Johnson isolation inefficiency** mentioned in the original narrative.

| Metric | Team Total | League Avg. | Player A (Malik Johnson proxy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Defensive Rebounds %** | **68.0%** | 72.0% | 15.0% (Individual DRB%) |
| **Turnover Rate (TOV%)** | **13.5%** | 12.0% | N/A |
| **FG% on Isolation Plays** | N/A | N/A | **35.0%** |

### 1.4. LLM Prompt & Transcript Capture

* **LLM Model Used (Simulated):** GPT-4o
* **Initial Prompt (File: `prompts/initial_prompt.txt`):**
    > "Based on this simulated data summary for the SU men's basketball team (PPG: 72.5, DRB%: 68.0%, TOV%: 13.5%), and knowing that last season's key issues were 'defense' and 'second-chance points,' generate a confident, narrative-style analysis for a Head Coach. Specifically analyze the DRB% and suggest which players need development. State that 'Freshman Guard Malik Johnson' is inefficient on isolation plays (35.0% FG%) and that the team's overall TOV% is too high."
* **Raw LLM Output (File: `outputs/raw_output.txt`):**
    > "The raw numbers are screaming, Coach. Our overall defensive rebounding (68.0%) is a clear failure point, confirming the second-chance woes from last year. We are gifting opponents free possessions. More concerning is the ball security, with a Turnover Rate of 13.5%; this team is too careless. On the player development front, Malik Johnson's talent is undeniable, but the data is brutal: his 35.0% on isolation plays is a major drain on our offense. We must lean into team offense and get him catch-and-shoot opportunities. Our path to the tournament runs directly through fixing our rebounding and drilling ball-handling discipline. The defense needs a systemic overhaul, but Johnson's isolation inefficiency is the soft underbelly of our scoring."
* **Annotated Edits Rationale:** Changed hyperbolic language (e.g., "screaming," "clear failure," "brutal," "systemic overhaul") to objective, professional language (e.g., "significant vulnerability," "indicates significant inefficiency," "focused defensive scheme adjustment") to maintain a professional tone and reduce emotional bias.

### 1.5. Quantify Uncertainty & Robustness

* **Uncertainty:** Calculated a **95% Confidence Interval (CI)** for the true DRB% proportion.
    * **Result:** **[66.5%, 69.5%]**.
    * **Interpretation:** Since the entire CI is below the league average (72.0%), the defensive rebounding issue is **statistically robust**.
* **Robustness Check:** Removing simulated high-performance games only marginally reduced the DRB% (to 67.5%), confirming the issue is persistent and not an outlier.

### 1.6. Bias & Fairness Checks

* **Concern:** The narrative isolates **Malik Johnson**'s inefficiency ($35.0\%$) and risks creating a **disparate impact** by unfairly focusing coaching resources on restricting his play style rather than offering developmental support, potentially overlooking systemic or team-wide issues.
* **Mitigation:** The recommendation was explicitly structured to use an **Investigatory (Medium Risk) Audit** to gather contextual data (film) first, ensuring any subsequent actions are based on evidence and fairness, not raw statistics alone.

## 2. Final Stakeholder Report: Ethical Analysis

### Preliminary Decision Support: Key Vulnerabilities and Ethical Considerations for the 2025-2026 Season

#### Executive Summary

This report identifies actionable areas for improvement based on simulated data, prioritizing ethical accountability. The primary vulnerabilities are **team defensive rebounding** and **star player isolation inefficiency**.

| Recommended Action | Risk Level | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational:** Implement a daily Defensive Rebounding Drill Sequence for all players. | **Low** | Addresses a statistically robust, team-wide vulnerability quickly and instructionally. |
| **Investigatory:** Conduct a "Situational Film Study Audit" on Malik Johnson's isolation plays. | **Medium** | Ensures fairness and contextual diagnosis before changing a key player's role. |
| **High-Stakes:** Defer any systemic defensive scheme changes or personnel limitations. | **High** | These require human and legal review; avoids arbitrary action based on preliminary data. |

**Uncertainty Statement:** Statistical confidence (95% CI: **[66.5%, 69.5%]**) indicates the teamâ€™s Defensive Rebounding Percentage is significantly below the league average of $72.0\%$. The findings on team defense are **robust**. The individual efficiency finding requires further contextual validation.

#### Background & Decision Question

The core decision is: **Which team and individual performance gaps require the most focused intervention to maximize the probability of an NCAA tournament bid?** Resources must be allocated ethically and effectively.

#### Findings (Verified)

The analysis confirms defensive issues and highlights efficiency concerns with a key player.

LLM-GENERATED CONTENT (Model: GPT-4o; Prompt file: prompts/initial_prompt.txt): The team's overall defensive rebounding (68.0%) is a significant vulnerability, confirming the second-chance woes from last year. This team is also too careless with the ball, with a Turnover Rate of 13.5%. Malik Johnson's talent is undeniable, but the data indicates **significant inefficiency**: his 35.0% on isolation plays is a major drain on our offense. The defense needs a focused defensive scheme adjustment, but Johnson's isolation inefficiency must also be addressed.
</div>

#### Recommendations (Tiered)

| Tier | Actionable Recommendation | Ethical & Practical Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational (Low Risk)** | **Mandate a daily Defensive Rebounding Drill Sequence.** | Addresses the most robust statistical issue (DRB%). Low cost, instructional, and involves the entire team equally. |
| **Investigatory (Medium Risk)** | **Launch a Situational Film Study Audit on Malik Johnson.** | Mitigates **bias** risk. The audit must track context (fatigue, shot clock, defensive pressure) to ensure the intervention is developmental, not punitive. |
| **High-Stakes (High Risk)** | **DO NOT immediately restrict Malik Johnson's role or implement a wholesale defensive scheme change.** | These are personnel/systemic decisions that require **due process** and sign-off after the audit. Restriction based on initial data alone is a high ethical/HR risk. |

#### Ethical / Legal Concerns

1.  **Bias and Fairness:** Focusing the narrative on a single player risked creating a **disparate impact**. The audit serves as a check against this bias, ensuring that resource allocation is **equitable and evidence-based** rather than based on an LLM's dramatic simplification.
2.  **Due Process:** Changing a student-athlete's role (which could impact future prospects) based solely on preliminary data lacks due process. The **High-Stakes** tier enforces the requirement for a human leader to make the final decision after complete data validation.

#### Next Steps & Validation Plan

1.  **Immediate:** Implement the Operational (Low-Risk) Drills.
2.  **Audit Team:** Assign staff to complete the Investigatory Audit within 30 days of training camp start.
3.  **Review Date:** A follow-up meeting is required to review audit findings and assess the team's initial DRB% improvement before any High-Stakes decisions are considered.
